Shishi is a dynamic parser and lexer library. Unlike yacc, it doesn't
provide you with a means of compiling a parser (yet) which you can link
into your program; instead, it allows you to create a parser "object"
and add rules to it before throwing text at it to parse. You may add and
remove rules at parser runtime, and switch between entire parser
rulesets. You may specify things to be recognised either as single
characters, strings, designated tokens, or even by passing in a function
pointer which returns whether or not the rule matched.

There is a small example in the file test.c; the directory Shishi
contains a Perl wrapper for this library. There's much more
documentation in there.

For Perl users:

    make
    cd Shishi
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

This will create shishi as a static library, and compile it into the
Shishi XS extension. 

Shishi takes its name from the Shishigami, the mystical deer-god of life
and death in Hideo Miyazaki's classic anime, Mononokehime.
